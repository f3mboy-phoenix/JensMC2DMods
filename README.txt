Ok, so this repo is for Jens MC2D mods made by F3mboy-Phoenix
It is a work in progress. At this time no debugging is being done
Laptop fried, using nano in termux on my phone to even write and push this >~<
Luckly all of the code is in notebooks that ive spent 4 years on so... the code should be mostly fine, as of now it is uncertain if it is fully functionable. Eventually i should place the code into proper tns files for release.

So that is it. To start I am working on the Advanced Modding Framework

It is to make modding simpler and easier to work with other mods.
Kinda like Forge, But it doesen't load the mods the game does

I plan to patch the framework into a game version eventualy but it'll stay a mod for now....
